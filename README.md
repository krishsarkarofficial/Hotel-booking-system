## ‚ú® Features

1. **Room Types**  
   - The hotel supports two room types: **Suite Room** and **Standard Room**.  
   - Each room has attributes like **room number**, **price**, and **availability status**.

2. **Reservation Options**  
   - **View Available Rooms**:  
     Displays rooms that are currently available, showing room numbers and prices.  
   - **Book a Room**:  
     Users input the room number and customer details (name, email, phone).  
     If the room is available, a `Reservation` object is created linking the customer and the room.  
   - **Cancel Reservation**:  
     Users can cancel an existing reservation by entering the room number.  
     The room's availability status is updated accordingly.

3. **Exit Option**  
   - Cleanly exits the system.

> The main loop offers these options continuously, allowing users to manage reservations efficiently.  
> The application ensures that only available rooms can be booked and only reserved rooms can be cancelled.
